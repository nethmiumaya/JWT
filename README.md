# JWT Repository

This repository, available at [nethmiumaya/JWT](https://github.com/nethmiumaya/JWT.git), is designed to implement and demonstrate the functionality of JSON Web Tokens (JWT). JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties and is commonly used for authentication and secure data exchange in web applications.

## Features

- **Token Generation**: Create secure and signed JWTs.
- **Token Verification**: Validate JWTs to ensure authenticity and integrity.
- **Custom Claims**: Add custom data to the token payload for specific application needs.
- **Expiration Handling**: Manage token lifetimes to enhance security.

## Prerequisites

- **Programming Language**: Specify the programming language and version used in this project.
- **Dependencies**: List all required libraries or frameworks (e.g., `jsonwebtoken` for Node.js, `pyjwt` for Python, etc.).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nethmiumaya/JWT.git
   cd JWT
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
